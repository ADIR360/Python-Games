# Fun Python Projects

### Overview
This repository contains my early Python projects, which include a **Ping Pong Game** and a **Facial Recognition System**. These were created as part of my journey to learn Python and will be updated in the future with more versatile games and tools. The projects serve as both a learning resource and a foundation for more advanced features and functionalities.

## Projects

### 1. Ping Pong Game
A simple two-player ping pong game built using **Python** and the **Pygame library**. The game simulates a classic ping pong match with basic physics, scorekeeping, and keyboard controls.

#### Features:
- Two-player support with keyboard controls.
- Ball speed increases over time, adding difficulty.
- Scoreboard to track the winner.

#### How to Play:
- **Player 1 controls:** `W` and `S` to move the paddle.
- **Player 2 controls:** Up and Down arrow keys to move the paddle.
- Score points by hitting the ball past your opponentâ€™s paddle.

#### Installation:
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/python-ping-pong.git
    cd python-ping-pong
    ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install pygame
    ```

3. Run the game:
    ```bash
    python ping_pong.py
    ```

### 2. Facial Recognition System
A basic facial recognition system that uses **OpenCV** and the **Haar Cascade** classifier to detect faces in real-time through your webcam.

#### Features:
- Real-time face detection using the Haar Cascade algorithm.
- Displays a bounding box around detected faces.

#### Installation:
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/facial-recognition-system.git
    cd facial-recognition-system
    ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install opencv-python
    ```

3. Run the facial recognition script:
    ```bash
    python facial_recognition.py
    ```

#### Future Updates:
- Adding face recognition and matching.
- Optimizing the algorithm for better accuracy and performance.
- Integrating with other security tools for a more comprehensive system.

### Future Plans

I plan to expand this repository with:
- More Python-based games such as **Snake**, **Tetris**, and **Brick Breaker**.
- Additional features for the facial recognition system, including face matching and advanced security tools.
- Tools for network security and penetration testing using Python.
